  <row Id="9" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2017-08-02T19:49:14.807" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;The final fallback for market resolution (after all reporters have reported on an event and someone still believes the answer is wrong) is called Fork Resolution.  Only one fork can be active at a time per branch (in Augur, a branch is akin to an entire universe that is isolated from other universes).  Once a fork starts, all other markets that are awaiting reporter based resolution (this does not include automated reporting) are delayed until the fork resolves.  Once the fork resolves, all of those pending markets will migrate to the branch (universe) that won the fork.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that existing markets migrate to a particular world view is one of the first differences with AgnosticPM.  In AgnosticPM, the universe a market lives in is based entirely on markets that came before.  In Augur, while a market is created within a particular universe (branch), it will migrate forward to another branch if a fork occurs before the market settles.  The reason for this is because if a fork occurs, we must assume that reporters have been compromised and any reporting they do is invalid.  It is also assumed that the fork resolution process is the best answer we have to &quot;who was right&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how the fork resolution process actually works, its pretty simple.  Before the fork, there is REP (tokens) that is associated with a particular branch (universe).  This REP is traded on exchanges and has some market value.  When a fork occurs, a new branch is created (conceptually) for every possible outcome and each branch has a new REP token.  Anyone who holds the original REP token can convert (1:1 ratio) their token to a REP token on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; branch of the fork.  The act of converting your REP from the parent branch to a child is how you vote for which branch you think represents reality.  Once you have cast your vote, there is no going back so be certain!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the fork (currently ~2 months) whichever branch had the most REP migrated to it is considered the winner and all existing markets needing reporting will migrate to that branch, and share tokens for the forking market will be redeemed using the outcome from that branch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This begs the question, why would I risk my REP casting a vote instead of just keeping my original REP?  The answer to this is that no new markets can be created on the original branch and all existing markets will resolve on the winning branch.  This means that REP on the original branch will yield no reporting fees to REP holders as there will be no markets to report on.  As a REP holder, your job is to pick the branch that you think the most future fees will come from.  This means you want to pick the branch that has the most market participation (volume/outstanding interest) so your REP gets the maximum amount of fees long term.  In almost all cases, this will be the branch that represents the truth/reality.  The only cases where this is less certain are forks that are highly contentious, where not everyone agrees on what reality even means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to incentivize people to migrate their REP during the voting period (tentatively 2 months), there will likely be some small inflation assigned to everyone who migrates sooner rather than later (e.g., 5%).  The idea here is that if you pick a side (rather than abstaining) then your share of REP will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be diluted.  If you abstain, then your share of REP will be diluted by some amount relative to how many people migrate.  The goal here is to make it so abstaining from the vote is a losing strategy in almost all cases (non-contentious forks) as this increases the cost of mounting a forking attack against Augur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding AgnosticPM, Augur is &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; in that it has a concept of branches (universes) which have a history of truths associated with them.  The primary difference between Augur and AgnosticPM is that Augur has a concept of finality, meaning that the system has the ability to assert that a particular outcome is an absolute truth for the sake of paying out winnings.  In AgnosticPM, there is no way to extract deposited ETH from the system, its ETH-in-only.  This is a pretty huge difference as it means that AgnosticPM, while fun and possibly effective, doesn't have a way of liquidating its ETH holdings back to participants to payout.  As long as AgnosticPM experiences heavy growth, this may not be a problem but if it ever ceases to experience usage growth then this becomes a big problem.  Investors know this, which will likely make them hesitant to buy any AgnosticPM share tokens, which is likely to drive their value to below 1 ETH (their target).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastEditorUserId="13" LastEditDate="2017-08-03T00:20:01.090" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T00:20:01.090" CommentCount="4" />

There will be one instance of REP per branch (universe), but similar to ETH, outside of a contentious fork there will ever only be one instance that is really meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ShareToken&lt;/code&gt;: The second most well known token, this is what you get when you buy shares in a market.  There is a unique instance of this token per outcome per market.  When the market closes and is finalized (reported on without contest), then the ShareToken that represents the winning outcome will be redeemable for full share value (minus fees) while all of the others will expire worthless.  You can buy a complete set of ShareTokens (meaning one of each outcome) for the cost of full share value, and if you acquire a complete set you can also sell them for full share value (minus fees).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RegistrationToken&lt;/code&gt;: This is just a token you can buy for a fixed amount of REP that will enable you to report in the next reporting window.  If you don't register, you can still report (tentatively) but you will not be eligible for reporting fee payouts.  If you register and then show up for reporting, you will be able to redeem your RegistrationToken for the REP you paid to buy it.  If you don't show up, your registration fee will be forfeited.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReportingToken&lt;/code&gt;: As a reporter, when you participate in reporting you trade REP for ReportingTokens.

Internally, the Augur team has referred to it as the problem of derivative financial markets.  The short version of the problem is that in order for REP to remain secure, the system needs to know the total value at risk so it can accurately assess how valuable REP must be in order to effectively secure that much value at risk.  If enough people have assets attached to Augur indirectly (in a way that Augur doesn't know how to account for) such that the cost of launching an attack against REP is less than the profit to be made from such an attack then the security model has broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the link you provided suggests, this is an as-of-yet unsolved problem.  The tentative plan is to move forward with recognition of this problem and closely monitor the system at launch.  If Augur is wildly successful, then it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that its internal volume will outpace derived volume.  In that case, we (the community) merely need to watch from the outside and pay attention to how much value is at risk in derivative markets.  If derivative markets start to surpass Augur's internal volume, then the first step is to approach the authors of the derivatives markets (off-chain, human interaction) and see if they would be willing to hook in to Augur's Oracle system more closely (and pay fees, which are presumed to likely be very low).  The reason one may choose to do this is because if they are dependent on Augur as an Oracle and the Oracle fails, they fail as well.  0.01% trading fee (or whatever it is) may be well worth it to someone who is big enough to be a risk to Augur's security model if it helps ensure their system remains secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For smaller fish, who may be less interested in &quot;contributing their fair share&quot; to system security, as long as Augur and big fish derivative markets &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; paying their fair share then the system is designed to handle a bit off lossiness in the value at risk calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real problem arrives if you have an actor that not only is wildly successful and dependent on Augur's Oracle, but is also unwilling to pay for the security costs that lead to their success.  In general, such an actor needs to either be uninformed as to the risk they are taking or not financially motivated.  At the moment, we aren't terribly worried about such actors in the ecosystem, and initially the Ethereum ecosystem is small enough that we can likely run a successful smear campaign against such an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Augur &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; want derivative markets (and other interesting things) built on top of the Augur Oracle.  As long as people doing this recognize that security isn't free, it is possible (likely?) that they will be willing to contribute the very small cost associated with maintaining enough security to cover their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; security costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T05:06:05.003" CommentCount="0" />

Of course, the red square is not in a sense a better square; they could win by both choosing any square. And it is only the &quot;right&quot; square to select if a player can be sure that the other player has selected it; but by hypothesis neither can.

Originally, in a market like &quot;Who will win the World Cup?&quot;, the goal for reporters was to report the same way as all other reporters.  Given no knowledge of who else is reporting, the best way to answer that is likely to result in you reporting the same way as everyone else is to report who actually won the world cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, the reporting system is mostly a performance optimization on top of the forking system, and we no longer try to stop people from colluding.  Because we assert the fork system to be secure (but very slow and expensive), we can then assume that people will report the way the forking system &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; resolve if it came to that, because ultimately it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come to that if people report against what the forking system would report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The forking system similarly doesn't really use a focal point but instead market dynamics put significant financial pressure on participants to choose the outcome that they think the most future Augur users will prefer, as that is where REP will hold the highest future value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T22:04:06.850" CommentCount="0" />

LLL, Serpent, and Solidity all can be used to write contracts. Solidity is the flagship language at the moment. Serpent used to be the flagship language. LLL was, as far as I can tell, a &quot;let's get something higher-level than EVM assembler language going real quick&quot; effort. They all get reduced down to EVM bytecode anyway, so it's really just a question of personal preference which one you use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That said, Solidity is still under development and may change out from under you.

In Augur markets the number of complete sets issued or shares available of each outcome is open interest. Fees used to be charged on market volume, but these are avoidable using systems like 0x, and aren't actually closely tied to the security model. Open interest, however, is because the open interest in a given market determines how much money is stored in that market at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So open interest is decreased and fees are charged when a market has closed and someone has won / holds shares with value at the end, or when a complete set is closed out or sold (i.e. closing a short position does this).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Augur, we want the fees to be as economically efficient as possible, ensure reporters get paid as much as they should, and be non rent-seeking. The old fee structure split fees between reporters and market creators, and let market creators decide the fee, which could result in reporters being paid too much or too little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, market creators choose their own fee which goes solely to them (these will trend quite low over time I imagine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, reporters get paid such that the market cap of rep is &gt;=5x the value of all outstanding money (i.e. outstanding/open interest) in Augur markets. If the market cap of rep is below this, fees increase. If it's above this, fees decrease. You can think of it similar to how companies like Amazon don't pay out anything in the beginning and charge low fees to boost growth, but once they mature more they start actually charging a bit more to make more money. In the beginning rep's value will be primarily driven by speculation so fees will be low. As time goes on people will hold rep (this could be many years off) for reporting and earning fees from doing that more than its pure speculative value (think Coca Cola vs a rapidly growing startup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a trader, say your shares were worth $100 at the end and the market creator fee was 0.05% and the reporter fee to maintain the invariant above was 0.1%, you'd get back $99.85 at market resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more commentary / discussion on this see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Augur/comments/6vwkkj/why_have_you_decided_against_honoring_your/dm4pou5/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reddit Thread on Fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="96" LastEditorUserId="96" LastEditDate="2017-08-25T22:50:36.387" LastActivityDate="2017-08-25T22:50:36.387" CommentCount="2" />

The new fee structure &lt;em&gt;guarantees&lt;/em&gt; both that the security of the system remains strong in the face of any potential future growth path the platform may take and it has the really nice side effect of guaranteeing that REP holders will continue to receive dividends no matter how people act in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a change from the original plan, this change does work out significantly better for REP holders in a number of possible futures, most of which &lt;em&gt;I personally&lt;/em&gt; think are very likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now we have to settle for 0.1%&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The linked answer was just using 0.1% as an example.  The fee will dynamically adjust to keep REP market cap at the target required for the security model (tentatively 5x open interest in Augur).  The fee is currently bounded (subject to change) to [0.01%, 50%] of all trades (not of all fees).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You have reduced the value of your own token by 5 fold&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After further research was done on the original model, it turned out that % of trading fees would likely lead to REP holders actually making very little.  There are a couple reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no significant pressure on market creators to charge high trading fees.  In fact, if people are making good money as market makers/bookies, they are very likely to create markets with 0% trading fees in order to incentivize higher trading volume, which is where they make their money.  Long term I expect that most market creators will play the role of market maker so I believe this to be a &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not possible to force people to trade on-chain, and in fact there are strong disincentives (gas costs, block time, etc.) &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; on-chain trading.  Augur cannot charge fees for off-chain trades (or even trades that happen on a different exchange) so most trading fees would (in the long run) be missed out on anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 50% fee structure resulted in some bad incentives for market creators to seek alternative fee sources (such as market making) so they wouldn't have to share their fees with the reporters.  This is really just an extension of (1), but it is significant enough to call out separately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the original model, REP holders would have earned 50% of likely epsilon% fees of a very small portion of trades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the new model, there are strong guarantees that REP holders will earn enough fees to incentivize people to trade REP at a target value.

As a result, it seems that active reporters will demand a nontrivial earnings yield (e.g. 5%/year) in exchange for being active. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on my understanding of the fee structure, it appears very likely that the reporter participation rate will be dangerously low from a security perspective.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if annual betting volume is $1B and if the average trading time horizon is 5 days and if reporters demand a 5% earnings yield, it implies the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average Open Interest = $13.7m ($1B * 5 days / 365 days)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target Market Cap = $68m ($13.7m * 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual Market Cap = $600m (or any number over $68m)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter Fee Rate = 0.01% because it keeps falling in order to make the actual market cap reach the target market cap, but because of speculation the market cap doesn't go low enough and the reporter fee bottoms out at 0.01%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter Revenues = $0.1m (0.01% * $1B)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter Participation Rate = Only 0.33% of reporters would spend the time reporting since for active reporters to earn a 5% earnings yield, most would reporters would have to become dormant until only 0.33% actually report.

There is no longer a concept of active or dormant REP.  The only requirement to participate in reporting is to pay a registration fee (currently 1 REP, subject to change) sometime before the upcoming reporting window.  As long as you show up and report during the window (currently 30 days, subject to change), you will get that registration fee back in full.  As long as you report correctly, you will not lose any REP and if you decide not to report you will only forfeit your registration fee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a likely scenario where people will report if they believe it is worth the labor costs to them.  In your example you have $100,000 in fees being paid out to reporters.  This means that in the most pathological case where only one person is reporting, that person gets $100,000 for doing it (very good money).  Most likely, people will notice that and join in to get their share of that $100,000 until it is divided up so much that the new reporters wouldn't make enough to cover costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, how big your share of the $100,000 depends on how much REP you stake during reporting, which is bounded by how much REP you control so things are a bit more nuanced than the above but the general idea remains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the security of the system is only dependent on the forking system being secure.  Everything else is an optimization.  The system can function fully and securely with a single reporter reporting on all events.

In order to win a fork, (assuming everyone is perfectly efficient) the attacker must buy more than 50% (often referred to as 51% for simplicity) of REP to force the fork to resolve incorrectly.  Afterwards, the market will likely assign no value to the attacker's fork of REP and assign notable value to the remaining un-forked REP. This means that the attacker will effectively &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; all of the money they used to buy up the 50% of REP required to launch the attack.  This gives us the cost of the attack as being 50% of REP market cap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again assuming perfectly efficient actors (worst case scenario), the attacker's best strategy would be to buy incorrect shares in every market for epsilon (very small number) dollars each, then resolve all of those markets incorrectly and redeem the winning (but incorrect) shares for full share value.  This means the most the attacker can make from this attack is all of the open interest across all current Augur markets (but not future markets).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have established the maximum profit from an attack (Augur open interest) and the minimum cost of an attack (50% of REP market cap), we can assert that in order for the system to ensure that an attack of this style is not profitable (still assuming everything is perfectly efficient) we need to ensure that REP market cap is 2 times larger than Augur open interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in reality things aren't perfectly efficient, especially in blockchains with long block times and many programming constraints.  Both the attacker is inefficient and the defenders are inefficient.  Because of this, we want to give some wiggle room for the security model so that it can still secure the system even in the face of these inefficiencies.  To achieve this shock/inefficiency resistance we need to increase the multiplier to something greater than 2x.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why not 100x?  The higher the number, the more traders have to pay for security.  If the traders are overpaying for security by too much, they will leave the platform for a competing platform that more appropriately charges for security.  This gives us some downward pressure on this number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The development team felt that 5x was sufficiently bigger than 2x such that there should be no problem withstanding shocks to the system or defense inefficiencies while also not being so large as to be an undue burden on traders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2017-08-28T17:09:09.990" CommentCount="0" />

Bob owns one share of NO in the same market.  This can be phrased as Alice is long on YES and Bob is short on YES (inversely, you could interpret this as Alice is short on NO and Bob is long on NO).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alice creates an order indicating she wants to sell a YES share (this would be in the form of an ASK).  Since she has a YES share, she will escrow that YES share along with her order.  The current market price for YES is 0.6ETH so she prices the order indicating she wants 0.6 ETH for her YES share.  This is Alice creating an order to close her position @ 0.6 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bob also wants to close his position, and he sees that Alice has an order on the books indicating she wants to sell her YES share.  Since Bob has a NO share and a YES+NO makes a complete set, the system can mutually close out both users at the same time if Bob fills this order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Bob fills the order, he will submit his NO share along with his request.

In Augur, the desired outcome is that the reporter tells the truth during reporting and the undesirable outcome is that they lie during reporting.  The token provides a mechanism such that users can put resources into escrow that they will get back later if they behave appropriately.  Without a token, the system would become susceptible to Sybil attacks as reporters could just create a bunch of accounts and report and we would have no way to punish them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the second is more complicated, but in almost all cases tokens associated with projects fail to meet this criteria.  That is, you could just replace the token with ETH and the system would be better because there would be less friction since users presumably already have ETH to pay gas costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing about ETH (or any other token not tightly coupled with the dApp) is that a dApp cannot create it, nor can it control how it is used.  With a dApp token, the dApp has the ability to create more of that token as necessary or constrain how that token is used.  For Augur this is critical to the security model because we need a mechanism for rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior in some situations where there is not necessarily symmetry between good actors and bad actors.  In particular, during the Forking process we need a way to encourage people to participate in the fork vote by taking some action.  However, due to the nature of how the Oracle works we don't actually know who is lying and who is telling the truth, all we know is that people are making different choices.  This means we can't take REP away from the liars and give it to the truth tellers.  Instead, we &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; REP (out of thin air) in each universe that branches off of the fork, thereby increasing the total supply of rep across all universes.  If we were to use ETH, this would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads into the second part, ETH cannot be constrained.  When a fork occurs and multiple universes spin up (each with a different definition of what is true) the system doesn't know which one is &quot;right&quot; and which is &quot;wrong&quot;, it is all subjective from the point of view of the contracts.  However, we want people to feel the impact of their decisions so when a fork occurs we create new REP tokens for each universe.  When users move their tokens to a universe they believe in, those tokens now &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work in that universe.  If someone chooses to move their tokens to a universe that no one else wants to be a part of, then the value of their REP decreases to 0 because no one wants their crappy Universe XYZ REP.  Everyone wants Universe ABC REP.  If we were to use ETH as the token we couldn't constrain how it is used.  People would be free to migrate their ETH to either universe and if it turns out they chose wrong and migrated their ETH to a universe no one wanted to play in, they could simply withdraw their ETH and deposit it in the other universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, based on the above analysis, Augur both needs a token at all and that token cannot be replaced with any other token or ETH.  Many dApps don't need a token at all and would work great without a token.  Most dApps that do need a token to function would function just fine by replacing their token with ETH or any other token.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13" LastActivityDate="2017-10-04T23:50:43.087" CommentCount="0" />

So for the &quot;continuous forking attack&quot; to work, the final bond must be in favor of the True outcome every time. That's how the attacker keeps a large enough bankroll to fork continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, presumably, the attacker will be the only person that is filling dispute bonds in favor of False outcomes (which is necessary during at least half of the dispute rounds in order for the attacker to cause a fork). So, for the attacker to recoup that loss, they also need to be the only person disputing false tentative outcomes in favor of the True outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put that another way: Any honest person who contributes dispute stake against the attacker's False tentative outcomes is cutting into the attacker's bankroll. This forms a race condition in our (honest participants') favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this attack to work, the attacker must be fast enough to fill the dispute bonds (at least the bonds disputing False outcomes in favor of the True outcome) before any honest participant is able to contribute to those bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why we consider it an unlikely attack. Honest whales (or even crowdsource contracts) could cut such an attacker off at the knees.(edited) [2:03 AM] Austin-Williams: In the unlikely event that it does end up being a problem, we do have a backup plan: tweak the dispute bonds so that some of the REP staked on false outcomes is burned. (That's is, rather than giving all of the REP staked on false to the users who staked on true, we would give most of the REP staked on false to users who staked on true, and then burn the rest.) The result is that all forks would reduce the bankroll of this class of attacker. [2:05 AM] Augurfan: thanks. sick reponse. 1 [2:06 AM] Augurfan: i guess the question is what if the person is large enough to manipulate Marketcap of Augur [2:06 AM] Augurfan: to make the bond very small [2:07 AM] Augurfan: right now its very easy since REP only exists on poloniex / bittrex [2:07 AM] Micah: They would need to manipulate down, which is hard. 1 [2:07 AM] Austin-Williams: Such an attacker would be able to reduce the market cap below our integrity requirements -- so that kind of an attacker would be able to do much worse than continuously fork.... they'd actually be able to make a given market resolve False. [2:08 AM] Austin-Williams: It seems super irrational though. [2:08 AM] Micah: The attacker would need to legitimately pressure the price down. Not just caues it to temporarily spike down on exchanges by selling a ton to clear the books. 1 [2:09 AM] Micah: And applying that much downward pressure for a sustained period, against the upward pressures that Augur provides would be insanely expensive.(edited) [2:09 AM] Augurfan: spam the ethereum network?
